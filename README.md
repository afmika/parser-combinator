# parser-combinator
Parser combinator from scratch using javascript
- The base concept is to construct a complex parser by combining elementary parts
- Rules :
 - We are not allowed to change/mutate datas but we can determine an output given an input
 - We can't do stuff in a procedural way (no while / for loops)
 - Curryfication is bae
 - No exception handling, just functions, if and else, constructors, recursion
