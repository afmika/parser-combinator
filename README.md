# parser-combinator

Pure parser combinator from scratch using javascript.

- The base concept is to construct a complex parser by combining elementary
  parts
- Rules :
  - Not allowed to change/mutate datas but we can determine an output given
    an input
  - No procedural code
  - No exception handling, just functions, if and else, constructors and recursion
